# Java-MOOC

Here are my solutions for the first part of Java mooc from University of Helsinki. The idea of the course is to do a lot of exercises in order to get your self familiar with java, rather than to do several problems each week. I found the first 4 parts really boring, since i have done several other introduction level courses. After that we focused on OOP, most of the exercises were pretty straightforward, but there are a lot of exercises, which helped me practice the concepts and get my self more familiar with basic OOP concepts.
